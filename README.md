Solutions to a few simple Project Euler problems using the OpenCL framework.

I primarily use python and C/C++ for solving problems; these solutions are just to learn OpenCL. As such, not all of them will be well optimized. The code should be portable to any OpenCL implementation, but it is only programmed to use a single GPU.
